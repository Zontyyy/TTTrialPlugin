This is a test plugin for my tech team application. There is nothing really important in the README, but I'll list off some mechanics here

# How it works

The destruction listener looks out for crop-related blocks being destroyed by a player.
Then it checks with which item the block was destroyed and whether it was enchanted.
Fortune boosts the drop, durability boosts the, well, durability.
The former's enchantment level elevates the maximum amount the additional, randomly picked drop, can have.
The latter's enchantment level is basically what fraction the chance of receiving durability damage the item has.

# Defense against circumvention

In the pursuit of disallowing the acquirement of drop from the crops
when they are destroyed not by the player directly, I initially wanted to
write a uniqie event that triggers during any block event, and if the said block is
among crops and destroyed — I'd just cancel its loot. But it's a little too cumbersome,
so I ended up just going over the events that I found when researching this problem and
manually canceling them.

# Plugin Toggling

The last branch is the ability to toggle on/off the plugin for players individually,
which persists through restarts and can be forcibly toggled by moderators.

In order to add different roles as per a suggestion in the doc I'm using LuckPerms plugin.

I made a group [mods]. They have a permission [togglefarm].
This gives a full ability to manage other players by using a command [/toggle]
